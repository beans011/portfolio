  <!-- OVERVIEW SECTION -->
  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
	Bossman's Simulator is a game demo developed as part of my final year project at university.
        The game is set in a dark, low-poly neighbourhood where the player takes on the role of a small shop owner managing and expanding their business.
    </p>
    <p>
    From the start, my main objective was to design and implement a robust, modular architecture that could support future expansion. The project also served as an opportunity to explore
PS1-style visuals, aiming to create a cohesive and nostalgic aesthetic consistent across the environment and UI.
    </p>
    <p>
    Players engage in a simple gameplay loop of buying stock, selling products and arranging their shop layout. The shelf placement system is fully customisable, giving the player some freedom to design their own store.
    </p>
    <p>
    The game also features a basic NPC AI, where customers make purchasing decisions intelligently based on the randomly generated budgets, adding realism and variablity to each NPC.
    </p>
    <p>
    The core goal of the project was achieved; to build a stable and maintainable game framework free from major bugs. While not all planned features were implemented within the project timeline, 
the underlying architecture is designed for easy expansion, allowing new systems and content to be integrated smoothly in future iterations.
    </p>

  <!-- FEATURES / TECHNIQUES SECTION -->

    <h2>Features & Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Architecture — patterns such as Singletons, Observer and Factory were used to create many of the gameplay mechanics and underlying systems.</li>
      <li>Unity — as part of the development process I created a set of tools to help streamline the process. A cheat console was made to aid in testing and UI tools were created to speed up the process.</li>
      <li>Data Driven — a large section of the code can be applied to a variety of apps and software as the game was designed to be driven by data.</li>
    </ul>
