  <!-- OVERVIEW SECTION -->

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Banquet of Books is a classic RPG demo developed as part of a university unit designed to simulate the workflow of an indie game studio. The project followed Agile development practices,
utilising JIRA to plan sprints, manage tasks and ensure progress throughout production. This structure provided important experience in collaborative game development, time management and adapting to iterative feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
    My key contributions to the project included UI design and implementation, where I focused on creating a cohesive and functional user interface in line with the games art style, 
which also included creating the 'Fog of War' gameplay mechanic to add depth to exploration in the game.
I also played a large role in quality assurance through structured playtest, documenting feedback and resolving bugs to improve gameplay stability.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to my techincal roles, I also created a variety of tile art assets as well as taking an active role in level design where I created the library area. 
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the biggest challenges during development was maintaining a large codebase across multiple developers. To overcome this, our team used GitHub for version control and held regular meetings to merge versions and test main gameplay features.
