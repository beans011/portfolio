    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     I'm a recent graduate of Computer Games Development from Manchester Metropolitan University, with over three years of experience using Unity to create both personal and university projects. From Game-Jam style games to development tools that streamline the creation process.
    </p>
    <p>
    My background spans hands-on networking, gameplay systems, tool development, and active participation in game communities, allowing me to bring a variety of transferable skills and a collaborative mindset to every project.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of development, I’m passionate about games like Path of Exile, where I enjoy exploring the game’s intricate systems and engaging with its community. My interest in how complex mechanics and tools come together to shape player experiences continues to inspire my approach to creating efficient game systems and development tools.
